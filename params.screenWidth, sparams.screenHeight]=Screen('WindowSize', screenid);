PTB-INFO: NVIDIA Corporation - (null) GPU found. Trying to establish low-level access...
PTB-INFO: Connected to NVidia (null) GPU of NV-20 family with 2 display heads. Beamposition timestamping enabled.

PTB-WARNING: Querying rasterbeam-position doesn't work on your setup! (Returns a constant value 4352)
PTB-WARNING: This can happen if Psychtoolbox gets the mapping of connected displays to graphics card
PTB-WARNING: outputs wrong. See 'help DisplayOutputMappings' for tips on how to resolve this problem.



PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is NVIDIA Corporation :: GeForce GTX 970/PCIe/SSE2 :: 4.4.0 NVIDIA 343.22
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1024 , VBL Endline = -1
PTB-INFO: Beamposition queries unsupported or defective on this system. Using basic timestamping as fallback: Timestamps returned by Screen('Flip') will be less robust and accurate.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 16.660762 ms [60.021265 Hz]. (50 valid samples taken, stddev=0.128563 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 16.661390 ms [60.019001 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.


----- ! PTB - WARNING: SYNCHRONIZATION TROUBLE ! ----

One or more internal checks (see Warnings above) indicate that
queries of rasterbeam position are not properly working for your setup.

Psychtoolbox will work around this by using a different timing algorithm, 
but it will cause Screen('Flip') to report less accurate/robust timestamps
for stimulus timing.
Read 'help BeampositionQueries' for more info and troubleshooting tips.


PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.
